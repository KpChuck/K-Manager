			            <p>
			            	Make sure that you have built of the K-Klock apk! If you haven't, tap the yellow build button at the bottom right corner of K-Manager and install K-Klock when prompted.
			            </p>
			            <p>
			            	If you're rooted you can go to K-Manager Settings and enable silent installation of K-Klock!

			            	How do I move the my custom clock format to the right/left/center of the statusbar?
			            </h1>
			            <p>
			                Open K-Klock in substratum and tap on the 'Clock Style' option. Here you can select the clock position.<br/>
			                You can also choose whether to keep the clock visible on your lockscreen or not!
			            </p>
			            <p>
			                The Dynamic or Stock options lets you have a clock that changes dynamically.
			                The clock will change color along with the other statusbar icons against light backgrounds.
