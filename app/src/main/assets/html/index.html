			            <p>
			            	Make sure that you have built of the K-Klock apk! If you haven't, tap the yellow build button at the bottom right corner of K-Manager and install K-Klock when prompted.
			            </p>
			            <p>
			            	If you're rooted you can go to K-Manager Settings and enable silent installation of K-Klock!

			            </h1>
			            <p>
			                Open K-Klock in substratum and tap on the 'Clock Style' option. Here you can select the clock position.<br/>
			                You can also choose whether to keep the clock visible on your lockscreen or not!
			            </p>
			            <p>
			                The Dynamic or Stock options lets you have a clock that changes dynamically.
			                The clock will change color along with the other statusbar icons against light backgrounds.

						<h1>How can I Hide the StatusBar Icons that Show up in Ambient Display/ on Lockscreen?</h1>
						<p>
							You need to use one of the following Clock Styles in substratum:<br>
							Clock on Lockscreen Left/Center/Right, No Clock on Lockscreen Right or Stock/Dynamic Clock Right.<br>
                            For the other clock styles these icons are necessary to hide the clock on the lockscreen.
						</p>
                        <p>
                            You could also use the 'Hide StatusBar Icons on Lockscreen' option in K-Manager (described below)
                        </p>

                        <h1>How does the Hide StatusBar Icons on Lockscreen option work?</h1>
                        <p>
                            This uses the stock SystemUI tuner to dynamically show/hide the statusbar icons
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would recommend that you try <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zacharee1.systemuituner&hl=en">
                            SystemUI Tuner
                        </a>
                            first to back up/restore your icons and to hide any that appear unwantedly
                        </p>

						<h1>The StatusBar Icons and Clock aren't aligned with everything else on the Lockscreen?</h1>
						<p>
							This does happen on some Roms.
							You can change the height of the lockscreen statusbar to the same height as the other statusbar icons.
							That way they will be aligned properly.

                        <h1>What's up with ADB commands?</h1>

                        <p>
                            These let you execute commands that you'd normally need root for without root.
							Just set up adb on your PC and run the commands
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There's a lot of guides out there on how to set up adb and troubleshoot it so give it a google
                        </p>
