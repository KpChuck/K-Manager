        <ul>
            <li>This option modifies the xml files necessary to create K-Klock on the go</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these xml files are different for each Rom
            <li>Fortunately K-Manager can now decompile your SystemUI.apk and extract those files</li>
            <li>If you're not rooted you will have to run an ADB command that you can copy to your clipboard if you try building</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            If that doesn't work, head over
            <a href="otherromsxml.html">to the guide</a>
            to see how you can extract the rom specific files yourself!

        <p>
            Add your Rom into the list of supported Roms in K-Manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have tested that your Other Roms options work, they can be added to K-Manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also use the Other Roms settings to add extra functionality for your Rom.

            <h1>Submitting files to be included in K-Manager - Guide</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Open K-Manager, select Other Roms as your Rom and tap on Other Roms Settings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press the Submit Files to K-Manager option, fill out your Rom details and an option will come up to send it to me
                    through Email or Telegram.
                </li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can fork K-Manager and make a pull request to submit the files</li>
                <li>
                    After following the above steps you can go to /sdcard/K-Klock and you should find a zip with the details you filled out.
                </li>
                <li>Place the zip into the
                    <b>app/src/main/assets/romSpecific</b>
                    folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have tested the Dev Options in K-Manager, open the file rom_instructions.xml in
                    <b>app/src/main/res/values</b>
                    and add your Rom to the lists there.<br>
                    <strong>Make sure that the text there is exactly the same as the name of your zip file without the .zip!</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then just open up a pull request on github and I'll merge your files into K-Manager
                </li>
            </ul>
