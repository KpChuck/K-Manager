        <ul>
            <li>This option modifies the xml files necessary to create K-Klock on the go</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these xml files are different for each Rom
            <li>Fortunately K-Manager can now decompile your SystemUI.apk and extract those files</li>
            <li>If you're not rooted you will have to run an ADB command that you can copy to your clipboard if you try building</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            Add your Rom into the list of supported Roms in K-Manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have tested that your Other Roms options work, they can be added to K-Manager.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also use the Other Roms settings to add extra functionality for your Rom.

            <h1>Submitting files to be included in K-Manager - Guide</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Open a filemanager and navigate to /sdcard/K-Klock. You should have a userInput folder there.
                </li>
                <li>Zip <b>all the xmls</b> inside your userInput folder. Rename the zip file to your name of your Rom with it's android version.
                    For example 'Paranoid Android Nougat.zip'
                </li>
                <li>You can fork K-Manager and make a pull request to submit the files</li>
                <li><em>Or just send it to me via email, telegram, xda.</em> If you do it this way, you can ignore the rest of this guide.</li>
                <li>If you're making a pull request,
                    place the zipped xmls into the
                    <b>app/src/main/assets/romSpecific</b>
                    folder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have tested the Dev Options in K-Manager, open the file rom_instructions.xml in
                    <b>app/src/main/res/values</b>
                    and add your Rom to the lists there.<br>
                    <strong>Make sure that the text there is exactly the same as the name of your zip file without the .zip!</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then just open up a pull request on github and I'll merge your files into K-Manager
                </li>
            </ul>
