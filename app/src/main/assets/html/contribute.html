            <p>
                Once you have tested that your Other Roms options work, they can be added to K-Manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also go into the K-Manager Settings and try the Developer Options for Other Roms to add extra functionality for your Rom.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Zip your userInput folder. Rename the zip file to your name of your Rom with it's android version.
                        For example Paranoid Android Nougat.zip
                    </li>
                    <li>You can fork K-Manager and make a pull request to submit the files.
                        Or just send it to me via email, telegram, xda.</li>
                    <li>If you're making a pull request,
                    place the zipped xmls into the
                        <b>app/src/main/assets/romSpecific</b>
                        folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have tested the Dev Options in K-Manager, open the file rom_instructions.xml in
                        <b>app/src/main/res/values</b>
                        and add your Rom to the lists there.<br>
                        <strong>Make sure that the text there is exactly the same as the name of your zip file without the .zip!</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
