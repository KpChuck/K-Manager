                    <li>This option modifies the xml files necessary to create K-Klock on the go</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately, these xml files are different for each Rom
                    <li>Since I don't have the xml files from every Rom, you'll have to provide these yourself</li>
                    <li>Below is an easy step-by-step guide that anyone should be able to follow</li>

                            It's faster than using a Pc for everything.

                        <h1>Access your Roms SystemUI.apk</h1>

                        <p>
                            You're going to need a PC for this part. Make sure you have Adb Drivers installed on your PC (Google how) if you're using Windows.
                            Open up a command terminal and type: 

                            <ol>
                                <li>adb pull /system/priv-app/SystemUI/SystemUI.apk</li>
                                <li>adb push SystemUI.apk /sdcard/</li>
                                <li>The location and name may differ slightly between devices</li>
                            </ol>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                             You should now have a file called SystemUI.apk in your internal storage.
                        </p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        
                        <h1>Find and decompile your Roms SystemUI.apk</h1>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Open up Apk Editor</li>
                            <li>Select the Apk from File option. </li>
                            <li>Now search for the SystemUI.apk that you extracted and decompile with Full Edit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Now select Files at the bottom of Apk Editor</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    
                        <h1>Exctracting the files</h1>
                        <p>
                            Navigate to res -> layout and select the following three xml's:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>keyguard_status_bar.xml</li>
                            <li>status_bar.xml</li>
                            <li>system_icons.xml</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Then use the Extract option at the bottom to extract the xmls to K-Klock/userInput (case-sensitive).
                        </p>
                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h1>The Fun Part!</h1>
                        <p>
                            Open up K-Manager and select the Other Roms option as your Rom.
                            You won't have to repeat this process unless those files are deleted or you change Roms.
                        </p>
                    </li>
